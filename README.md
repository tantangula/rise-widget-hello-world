# Hello World Widget

##Introduction

This widget is meant to be a starting point for anyone who wants to start building widgets for [Rise Vision's](http://www.risevision.com) digital signage system. I started by looking at the [widget-text](https://github.com/Rise-Vision/widget-text) widget written by [Donna Peplinskie](https://github.com/donnapep), and I took out everything that wasn't essential for a simple "Hello World" style widget. This widget only has a single text input field on the settings page that saves a string and sends it to an h2 tag in the widget. 

Disclaimer: I don't work for Rise Vision, and I only started looking into how these widgets work a week ago. This is a hack and slash job done on code I am still learning about. Because I don't know what I'm doing, the widget will generate some errors when you try to build it, but it will work just fine if you host all of the files from the gulp build on a web server and link to them from within a gadget created using the Rise Vision [dashboard](http://rva.risevision.com/).
